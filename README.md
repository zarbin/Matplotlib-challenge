Once duplicates were removed the mouse population = 248 (N = 248). Sex breakdown is 123 Female and 125 Male mice. Capomulin and Ramicane are the two most used drugs in treatment with Propriva being used the least. The success of the Capomulin treatment is evidenced in the line chart of mouse y793 as an example.

There was a significant outlier found in the Infubinol drug treatment regime with a final tumor volume of 36.32 that is far outside the whisker bounds.

With a correlation of 0.84, there is a strong positive correlation between weight and average tumor volume in the mice. Capomulin and Ramicane were also the most successful drugs in reducing the size of the tumors within the mice subjects and consequently the most used drugs in this study as evidenced in the bar graph.
